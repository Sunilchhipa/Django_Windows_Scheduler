        Windows_Scheduler is a simple Django app to schedule tasks on a windows machine using the built in Windows Task Scheduler
        
        This will provide an interface for the users of your application to setup the tasks without logging into your server and accessing TaskScheduler
        Task which needs to be setup(Eg: Send_Disk_usage_report.bat) should be setup in the server by admin or the user who has access to the server.
